Task 0:
Write a Bash script that transfers a file from our client to a server:

Requirements:

    Accepts 4 parameters
        The path to the file to be transferred
        The IP of the server we want to transfer the file to
        The username scp connects with
        The path to the SSH private key that scp uses
    Display Usage: 0-transfer_file PATH_TO_FILE IP USERNAME PATH_TO_SSH_KEY if less than 3 parameters passed
    scp must transfer the file to the user home directory ~/
    Strict host key checking must be disabled when using scp

Example:

Readme:

    -y on apt-get command

Web servers are the piece of software generating and serving HTML pages, let’s install one!

Requirements:

    Install nginx on your web-01
    server
    Nginx should be listening on port 80
    When querying Nginx at its root / with a GET request (requesting a page) using curl, it must return a page that contains the string Hello World!
    As an answer file, write a Bash script that configures a new Ubuntu machine to respect above requirements (this script will be run on the server itself)
    You can’t use systemctl for restarting nginx

TECH Domains is one of the top domain providers. They are known for the stability and quality of their DNS hosting solution. We partnered with .TECH Domains so that you can learn about DNS.

.TECH Domains worked with domain name registrars to give you access to a free domain name for a year. Please get the promo code in your tools space. Feel free to drop a thank you tweet for .TECH Domains.

Provide the domain name in your answer file.

Requirement:

    provide the domain name only (example: foobar.tech), no subdomain (example: www.foobar.tech)
    configure your DNS records with an A entry so that your root domain points to your web-01 IP address Warning: the propagation of your records can take time (~1-2 hours)
    go to your profile and enter your domain in the Project website url field

Example:

Readme:

    Replace a line with multiple lines with sed

Configure your Nginx server so that /redirect_me is redirecting to another page.

Requirements:

    The redirection must be a “301 Moved Permanently”
    You answer file should be a Bash script containing commands to automatically configure a Ubuntu machine to respect above requirements
    Using what you did with 1-install_nginx_web_server, write 3-redirection so that it configures a brand new Ubuntu machine to the requirements asked in this task

Example:

4:
Configure your Nginx server to have a custom 404 page that contains the string Ceci n'est pas une page.

Requirements:

    The page must return an HTTP 404 error code
    The page must contain the string Ceci n'est pas une page
    Using what you did with 3-redirection, write 4-not_found_page_404 so that it configures a brand new Ubuntu machine to the requirements asked in this task

Example:

5:
Time to practice configuring your server with Puppet! Just as you did before, we’d like you to install and configure an Nginx server using Puppet instead of Bash. To save time and effort, you should also include resources in your manifest to perform a 301 redirect when querying /redirect_me.

Requirements:

    Nginx should be listening on port 80
    When querying Nginx at its root / with a GET request (requesting a page) using curl, it must return a page that contains the string Hello World!
    The redirection must be a “301 Moved Permanently”
    Your answer file should be a Puppet manifest containing commands to automatically configure an Ubuntu machine to respect above requirements
